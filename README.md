# Climate Impact on Crop Production

This project analyzes the relationship between climate variables (such as temperature, rainfall, and humidity) and crop production trends.  
The goal is to understand how changing climate patterns affect agricultural yields and identify possible adaptation strategies.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Statistical analysis of climate factors vs. crop yields
- Predictive modeling for crop production
-
